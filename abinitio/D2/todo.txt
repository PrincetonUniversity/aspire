1. In D2SimulationExample, add comments to lines marked with COMMENT
2. Document input and output paramters in genDataForD2Simulation.
3. Document Input and output parameters in genRotations_Random. ALso add a description of this function (as a comment in the M-file). If that function is specific to D2, then you better think of another name.
4. Is there a reason to use quaterions in your code? We have elimiated them from all other places in ASPIRE.
5. Why do we need nCPU?
6. Document output of runD2
7. The default value for shift_step in runD2 is 1200. Why is that? I changed to 1.
