1. Integrate initpath into ASPIRE's initpath.
2. Remove 7770.mat. Download it from the iternet if necessary.
3. Update ASPIRE scripts to compile MEX files in these directories.
4. Eliminate subfolders if possible. There are too many subfolders, most seem to contain only one (or very few) files.
5. What is color_perms.mat? Is there a code to generate it? Can it be generated on-the-fly?
