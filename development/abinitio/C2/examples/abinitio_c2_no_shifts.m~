%% Load and display projections
% The MAT file p100_c4_shifted contains 100 projections of size 65x65. The
% orientations (given as quaternions) used to generate these projections
% are stored in the the variable "refq". The projection were generated using the following command:
[projs,refq] = generate_c2_images(100,100000000,65,'SYNTHETIC',0,1);

% load p100_c4_gaussian_no_shifts;
viewstack(projs,5,5);   % Display the proejctions.
