function prevpath = cvx_startup( quiet )

%CVX_STARTUP   Quietly add CVX to your MATLAB path (for startup).
%    Running CVX_STARTUP upon startup ensures that CVX is properly included
%    in your MATLAB path.
%
%    On Mac and PC systems, this function is not necessary, because you can
%    simply run "savepath" to save the CVX path changes permanently, or use
%    the "pathtool" command to do the same. In fact, CVX_SETUP attempts to
%    run "savepath" as part of its setup process.
%
%    On UNIX systems, the MATLAB installation is usually installed in such
%    a manner that individual users cannot change the global MATLAB path.
%    This can be circumvented by making the PATHDEF.M file world-writable;
%    but if the system serves multiple users, this may not be desirable.
%
%    CVX_STARTUP provides a simple solution to this problem. Simply add the
%    following line to the end of your local STARTUP.M file:
%        run <full_path_to_CVX>/cvx_startup
%    Note that using the "run" command *and* providing the full path to the
%    CVX installation are critical. With this change, CVX_STARTUP.M will be
%    called every time the user runs MATLAB.
%
%    Note that CVX_STARTUP is *not* a substitute for running CVX_SETUP.
%    Please run CVX_SETUP first when installing CVX, and *then* add the
%    CVX_STARTUP line if instructed to do so.
