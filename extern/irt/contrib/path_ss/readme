path manipulation tools by somesh srivastava.
motivated by a name conflict between my old deg2rad.m and matlab's version.

from his email:

I have solved the path problem by creating a function
delete_path. This function deletes paths that contain
a particular keyword. In this case, it is 'toolbox/map/'.
As an added feature, delete_path takes a cell array of strings as an input
and deletes all the keywords contained in the cell array from the path.

Please find attached the new setup.m and delete_path.m. Also included are
additional matlab functions for debugging: keep_path.m and print_path.m
