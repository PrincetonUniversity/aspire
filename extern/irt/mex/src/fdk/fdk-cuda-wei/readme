This directory contains part of the source code for building MEX files that do
the back-projection step of the FDK (Feldkamp)cone-beam image reconstruction
method using CUDA on GPU.

This code was written by Wenlay Esther Wei in Winter 2010 by modifying the
work of Matthew Lauer and Ryan James in order to improve the performance.
This FDK code is originally in ../fdk by Jeff Fessler.

Each folder contains source code for each speed-up strategy as well as related
information.  For more details, please read the project report contained in
this folder.

To compile, replace the fdk-ts.cu (and fdk-ts-t.cu for some versions) with the
counterparts in fdk-cuda folder, modify the Makefiles

To test, use cbct_back test command in MATLAB or modify the init2.m to use
your paths

To use CUDA compiler, modify init.m to add your paths

Please read the project report for more details

NOTE: Testing folder contains a simple CUDA file I made while learning the GPU
architecture, it generates a mex file
