This directory contains source code for building MEX files
that do the back-projection step of the FDK (Feldkamp)
cone-beam image reconstruction method using CUDA on GPU.

This code was written by Matthew Lauer and Ryan James in Summer 2009
by modifying the FDK code in ../fdk by Jeff Fessler.

To compile, modify one of the Makefiles to use the paths
to your installation of the CUDA library from Nvidia.
For example, on a mac use
	make -f Makefile,mac

After compiling, which creates fdk_mex.mex[suffix],
test as described in ../readme
