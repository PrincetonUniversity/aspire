A. TEST PROGRAM (1D SIGNAL AND 2D IMAGE)

  The file test_1d.c contains a short reduction and expansion example of a 1D signal.
  it is implemented as a main() function. The input data are created in the code. 
  The program displays the result on the console.
  There is also a similar test program for a 2D image in test_2d.c.


B. BASIC ROUTINES

  The Reduce_1D(), Reduce_2D(), Expand_1D() and Expand_2D() are in the 
  pyramidtools.c file.
  The file pyramidfilters.c contains the generation of the filters.


C. OTHER ROUTINES

  MessageDisplay.c contains a routine to print the string messsage on the console.
  Configs.h contains general definitions.

D. EXPLANATION

Software for generating spline pyramids
  This software package implements the basic REDUCE and EXPAND operators for the reduction and
  enlargement of signals and images by factors of two. A signal is represented by a polynomial spline
  which is a continuously-defined function [1]; the model is interpolating and is unambiguously
  defined by the sample values. The spline model specifies the enlargement mechanism (spline
  interpolation), as well as the reduction algorithm which is optimal in the least squares sense.

Model specification
  The user specifies the underlying spline model and error criterion by selecting the appropriate filters
  using the GetPyramidFilter subroutine. He can choose the degree of the spline (typ. n=3), and the
  type of error measure (discrete -norm [2] or continuous -norm [3]). Note that the differences
  between the two types of filters tend to vanish as the degree increases. The user also has the
  choice between a standard pyramid where the coarser grid points are at the even integers, and a
  centered one where the coarser grid points are placed in-between their two closest finer grid
  predecessors [4].

REDUCE operator
  It is implemented by the function Reduce_1D which filters and downsamples a signal by a factor of
  two. The reduction filter is designed such that the approximation error is minimized. For digital
  images or volumes, the function must be applied successively along the various dimensions of the
  data. A multiresolution decomposition (or pyramid) may be generated by repeated application of
  the REDUCE operator. Note that the evaluation of centered pyramids requires the use of the
  function ReduceCentered_1D instead. In all cases, the signals are extended using mirror boundary
  conditions to minimize border artifacts.

EXPAND operator
  It is implemented by the function Expand_1D which up-samples a signal by a factor of two and then
  fills-in the missing samples by application of a suitable interpolation filter. The interpolation filter is
  specified by the underlying spline model; for a given order n, it is the same irrespective of the type
  of criterion used to specify the REDUCE function. The expand operator uses boundary conditions
  that are compatible with the reduce operation. In the case of a centered pyramid, the interpolation
  is achieved by the ExpandCentered_1D, since the samples on the finer grid are shifted by half a
  sampling step. 

Error pyramid
  The loss of information due to image/signal reduction can be visualized in the error pyramid. The
  error signal is computed as follows: error = signal ­ EXPAND(REDUCE(signal)). In the present
  design, the REDUCE and EXPAND filters are biorthogonal and the system acts like a projector. This
  explains why the error is usually much smaller then the one obtained by using the Burt and Adelson
  filters associated with the Gaussian/Laplacian pyramid [5]. Also note that there is a close connection
  between these spline pyramids and wavelets as explained in [1].
