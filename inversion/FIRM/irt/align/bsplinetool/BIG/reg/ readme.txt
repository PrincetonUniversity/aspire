Important: the file 'main.c' is supposed to get you started in the
process of integrating this set of registration routines into your own
private system. It gives a description of the variables and of their
use. What it _doesn't_ do is to provide you with a working code for
calling the registration procedure. It gives just the outline; you'll
have to adapt the values to your own case. Link error: the procedure
'message()' is left voluntarily unimplemented, since IO's are strongly
system-dependent.

You'll be free to use this software for research purposes, but you
should not redistribute it without our consent. In addition, we expect
you to include a citation or acknowlegment whenever you present or
publish results that are based on it.
