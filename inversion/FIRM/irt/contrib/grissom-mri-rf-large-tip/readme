This directory contains code for MRI RF pulse design
in both the small-tip and large-tip regimes, for
parallel transmit cases.
This code was developed by Will Grissom initially while
he was at UM, and then continued when he was at Stanford.

The algorithms are based on this paper:

Fast large-tip-angle multidimensional and parallel RF pulse design in MRI

To see how the code works, run ptx_test.m

From a 2009-03-18 email from Will Grissom:

Gocrf.m: The fast optimal control object.
	Contains everything you need, including a spin-domain Bloch simulator.
exckspace.mat: Example accelerated spiral and EP trajectories
fdtdsens.mat: Steve Wright's simulated transmit sensitivities.
	I got his permission to include these here.
ptx_test.m: The script that puts it all together!
