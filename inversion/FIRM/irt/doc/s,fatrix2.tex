\subsection{The \fatrixx class}

Most iterative algorithms
for image reconstruction
are described conveniently using matrix notation,
but matrices are not necessarily
the most suitable data structure
for actually implementing an iterative algorithm
for large sized problems.
The \fatrixx class
provides a convenient bridge
between matrix notation
and practical system models
used for iterative image reconstruction.

Consider the simple iterative algorithm
for reconstructing \x from data \y
expressed mathematically:
\be
\x^{n+1} = \x^n + \alpha \A' (\y - \A\x^n)
,\ee{e,fatrixx,iter}
where \A is the \emph{system matrix}
associated with
the image reconstruction problem at hand.
%
If \A is small enough
to be stored as a matrix in \matlab
(sparse or full),
then this algorithm translates
very nicely into \matlab as follows.
%\begin{verbatim}
\be
\ty{x = x + alpha * A' * (y - A * x);}
\ee{e,mat2}
%\end{verbatim}
You really cannot get any closer connection
between the math and the program than this!
But often we work
with system models
that are too big to store
as matrices (even sparsely) in \matlab.
Instead,
the models
are implemented by subroutines
that compute the ``forward projection'' operation
$\A \x$
and the ``backprojection operation
$\A' \z$
for input vectors \x and \z respectively.
%
The conventional way
to use one of these system models
in \matlab (or C) would be to rewrite
the above program as follows.
\begin{verbatim}
Ax = forward_project(system_arguments, x)
residual = y - Ax;
correction = back_project(system_arguments, residual)
x = x + alpha * correction
\end{verbatim}
Yuch!
This is displeasing for two reasons.
First,
the code looks a \emph{lot} less like the mathematics.
Second,
usually you end up with a different version of the code
for every different system model
(forward/back-projector subroutine pair)
that you develop.
Having multiple versions
of a simple algorithm
creates a software maintenance headache.

The elegant solution
is to develop \matlab objects
that know how to perform
the following operations:
\blist
\item
\makebox[4em][l]{%
\ty{A * x}
}
(matrix vector multiplication,
operation \ty{mtimes})
\item
\makebox[4em][l]{%
\ty{A'}
}
(\ty{transpose}), and
\item
\makebox[4em][l]{%
\ty{A' * z}
}
(\ty{mtimes} again,
with a transposed object).
\elist
Once such an object is
defined,
one can use \emph{exactly}
the same iterative algorithm
that one would have used
with an ordinary matrix,
\eg,
\eref{e,mat2}.
%
The \fatrixx class
provides a convenient mechanism
for implementing
such linear operators.
%
Specifically,
suppose \x is of length 1000
and \y is of length 2000.
Then use the following call:
\begin{verbatimtab}
A = fatrix2('imask', [1000 1], 'omask', [2000 1], ...
	'arg', system_arguments, ...
	'forw', @forward_project, 'back', @back_project);
\end{verbatimtab}
The resulting \fatrixx object \ty{A}
acts just like a matrix
in most important respects.
In particular,
we can use exactly the same iterative algorithm
\eref{e,fatrixx,iter} as before,
because
\ty{A * x}
is handled internally
by calling
\[
\ty{
Ax = forward_project(system_arguments, x)
}
\]
and similarly for
\ty{A' * z}.

Basic operations
like \ty{A(:,7)}
are also implemented,
but nonlinear operations
like \ty{exp(A)}
are not
because those cannot be computed readily
using \ty{forward_project}. 

For many examples, see
the \ty{systems} subdirectory of \irt.

{
Support for arrays instead of columns
}

For an image reconstruction problem
with the mask illustrated in \fref{fig,reg,mask,6,5},
the size of \ty{A} should be
$\nd \times 8$
where \nd is the number of rows of \A.

So if we have a $6 \times 5$ image \ty{x}
and we would like to compute
$\A \x$,
conventionally
one would need to do the following:
\\
\cent{
\ty{y = A * x(mask)}
}

The statement \ty{x(mask)}
extracts the relevant $\np = 8$ values
out of the $6 \times 5$ array \ty{x}.

Objects in the \fatrixx class
often can spare the user the need to use \ty{x(mask)}
if the object is defined properly.

Suppose that in a tomographic image reconstruction problem
corresponding to \fref{fig,reg,mask,6,5},
the sinogram size is $9 \times 8$
so $\nd = 72$.

Then if \ty{A} is one of the predefined tomographic system models
in \irt such as \ty{Gtomo2_wtmex},
then the statement
\\
\cent{
\ty{yc = A * x(mask)}
}
\\
will produce \emph{column vector} \ty{yc}
with $\nd = 72$ elements.

On the other hand,
the convenient syntax
\\
\cent{
\ty{ya = A * x}
}
\\
will produce a $9 \times 8$ sinogram \emph{array} output \ty{ya}.
The two different outputs
are related by
\\
\cent{
\ty{yc = ya(:)}
}

In other words,
if the input is a column vector (of length \np),
then the output will also be a column vector,
just like one would expect for an ordinary matrix.
But if the input is an \emph{array},
of the appropriate dimensions,
then the output will also be an array.

When defining a new \fatrixx object,
there are several options
that one can use to specify
the appropriate dimensions.

\blist
\item
\ty{imask}
is the usual input mask.
Default is \ty{true(idim)}
\\
This can also be called just \ty{mask}
for backwards compatibility with \fatrix objects.

\item
\ty{idim}
describes the input array dimensions.
Default is \ty{sum(imask(:))},
\ie, an ordinary column vector.

\item
\ty{omask}
is a rarely used option.
Default is \ty{true(odim)}

\item
\ty{odim}
describes the output array dimensions.
Default is \ty{sum(omask(:))},
\ie, an ordinary column vector.
\elist

For a typical \fatrixx object,
one will use only the \ty{imask} and \ty{odim} options.

For the tomography example above,
we would add the name-value pairs
\ty{'odim', [9 8]}
to the \ty{fatrix2} call.


\subsubsection{Defining \fatrixx methods}

The key methods for a \fatrixx object
are the \ty{forw} and \ty{back} operations.
For the obsolete \fatrix objects,
these methods had to support columns and arrays
and multiples thereof
which made them fairly complicated.
For the new \fatrixx objects,
this complexity is handled by the object itself,
and the user-defined methods are much simpler.

The \ty{forw} routine
accepts a single input array
of size \ty{idim}
and returns a single output array
of size \ty{odim}.

(If there are nonzero values in the input array
outside of \ty{imask}
then the output results may be unpredictable

Conversely,
the \ty{back} routine
accepts a single input array
of size \ty{odim}
and returns a single output array
of size \ty{idim}.

Caution:
the output array of the \ty{back} routine
must be zero for any pixels
outsize of the \ty{omask}.

Unfortunately,
\matlab does not really support 1D arrays.
(\matlab's \ty{size} command always returns 
at least a two-element vectors.)
So for any application where
\ty{odim} is 1D,
such as MRI with irregular non-Cartesian k-space samples,
\ty{A' * y}
will produce a 1D array
not a 2D array
even if \ty{imask} is 2D,
because \ty{y} will be 1D in such cases.

\comment{
One could use \ty{Gcascade} or \ty{block_fatrix}
directly for these operations,
but it looks nicer
and is more ``\matlab like''
to use the new syntax.
