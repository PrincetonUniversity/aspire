\subsection{Related tools}

On 2007-1-28,
I noticed that there is another package called \ty{bbtools}
at \ty{http://nru.dk/bbtools}
that has a similar functionality called a ``black box.''
It is nicely documented.

On 2010-02-22 I became aware of the ``SPOT'' package
that has some similar functionality.
