This directory provides surrogates for various matlab routines
so that freemat will behave more like matlab.
This is very much under construction and will be greatly modified
after the next release of freemat.

submitted as bugs:
	t = {}; length(t); t = {t{2:end}}; length(t)
	second length should be 0, not 1!

	if condition
		% allow nothing here
	else
		statement
	end

conveniences:

submitted as feature requests:
	"clear" default to "clear all"

	exist(?, 'dir')

	gray(256) - accept argument even if ignored; return warning if not 256?

	the following work:
		error bug
		if 0<1, error('bug'), end
	but the following fails:
		if 0<1, error bug, end

	the following works:
		if (0 ~= 1), 42, end
	but not this:
		if 0 ~= 1, 42, end
