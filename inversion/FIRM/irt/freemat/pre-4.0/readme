This directory provides surrogates for various matlab routines
so that freemat will behave more like matlab.
This is very much under construction and should be modified
after each release of freemat.

wish list for 3.6:

graphics:
	get(0, 'children') % crashes freemat (on Mac)
	plot(rand(3)), title('test') % returns a handle, but should not
	subplot(131) % fails: freemat wants subplot('131') or subplot 131

path('newpath', path) % should not return [] if no output argument

help my_m_file	% shows only top line, rather than all comments at top!?
		% (i.e., when comments immediately follow function declaration)

persistent varname
	wrong behavior if varname happens to be a mfilename too

gui:
	^u should clear line
	page up / down keys don't work in cmd window (scroll wheel ok) on mac

online documentation needed:
	help subsasgn

feature enhancements:
	error('format', args...)
	out = where; (similar to dbstack)
	st = struct([]); % create empty struct

feature additions:
	inputname % missing
	cputime % missing
	dbstack % (or "where" output)

------- have not checked below here ---------

	subsref([3:5], struct('type', {'()'}, 'subs', {{1}}))

subroutines within @object directory not accessible to the
methods within that directory.
