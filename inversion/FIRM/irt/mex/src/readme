This directory contains source code for some of the mex routines
used in this toolbox.  So that PC users can try to compile those
mex routines if they are brave.

Not all the source code for all the mex files are included because
some involve too many source code files.

Subdirectories:

fdk:
	cone-beam CT back-projection

misc:
	miscellaneous routines

penalty:
	regularization
