%| Construct Gblock object, which is a 'meta' system object,
%| designed to work with ordered-subsets (aka block iterative) algorithms.
%| See Gblock_test.m for example usage.
%|
%| A Gblock system is created from another 'block-izable' base system object
%| 'base' by calling: Gb = Gblock(base, nblock, 1);
%|
%| Any projector object can be used if nblock=1, otherwise the base object
%| must have a "mtimes_block" method for block multiplications.
%|
%| The overloaded capabilities of a Gblock object include:
%|	Ab * x			full forward projection
%|	Ab' * y			full back projection
%|	Ab{i_block} * x		project one block (e.g., a set of views)
%|	Ab{i_block}' * x	back project one block
%|				i_block = 1,2,...,nubset
%|
%| Other properties are inherited from the base system object.
