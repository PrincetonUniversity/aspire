% DENOISE_IMAGES_ANALYTICAL Mean and denoised images from sPCA coefficients
%
% Usage
%    [mean_image, denoised] = denoise_images_analytical(U, fn, mean_coeff, ...
%        coeff, L, R, N);
%
% Input
%    U: A cell array containing the eigenvectors of the covariance blocks
%       C^{(1)} through C^{(k_max)}. The kth element contains the eigenvectors
%       C^{(k)}, arranged in columns.
%    fn: The inverse Fourier transform of the Fourier-Bessel basis vectors. This
%       is obtained using the function IFT_FB.
%    mean_coeff: The mean Fourier-Bessel coefficients for k = 0.
%    coeff: The sPCA coefficients obtained from Wiener filtering.
%    L0: The desired size of the output images.
%    N: The number of coefficients to process.
%
% Output
%    mean_image: The mean image in the spatial domain in a grid of size
%       L0-by-L0.
%    denoised: The denoised images, arranged in an array of size L0-by-L0-by-N.
