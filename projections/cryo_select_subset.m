function selected=cryo_select_subset(NNtbl,K,toimage,nn_skip)
%
% CRYO_SELECT_SUBSET    Select a subset of the class averages.
%
% selected=cryo_select_subset(NNtbl,K,formimage,toimage)
%   Select a subset of (indices of) K images that are not "too close" to each
%   other. 
%   NNtbl is a nearest neighbors table, where row i contains the
%   indices of the images that are most similar to image i. The rows of the
%   table are assumed to be sort according to "image quality", that is, row
%   1 correspons to the best image (class average), row 2 corresponds to
%   the second best, and so on. The number of rows is the number of images
%   in the dataset.
%   The function selects a subset as follows. It first selects the
%   best-quality image, then discards its neighbors, then selects the best
%   images in the remaining dataset, discards its neighbors, and so on. The
%   number of neighbors discrded at each step is such that we end with a
%   set of K images.
%   If toimage is given, the images are selected only from the range of
%   indices 1...toimage. Since the images are assumed to be sort by
%   quality, this allows choosing images that are "not too bad".
%
%   Input parameters:
%       NNtbl       Nearest neighbors table. A matrix with number of rows
%                   euqal to the number of images in the dataset. Row i in
%                   this table lists the nearest neighbors of image i.
%       K           Number of images to select.
%       toimage     Last image to consider for inclusion in the selected
%                   set. Default: size(NNtbl,1)
%       nn_skip     Number of nearest neighbors to eliminate for each
%                   selected image. Default value is set to allow a final
%                   set of size K.
%
%   Output parameters:
%       selected    List of indices of selected images
