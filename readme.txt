ASPIRE – Algorithms for Single Particle Reconstruction

Current version: 0.14
Date: 11/2018

Installation
------------
The following steps should be executed only once.
1. Download and extract the package.
   We will assume that the package has been extracted to a folder named ASPIRE.
2. Change into the directory ASPIRE and run “install”.
3. Change into the directory ASPIRE/projections/class_average/ and run “gen_simulation_data”.


Getting started
---------------
1. Enter the directory ASPIRE.
2. Run “initpath”
    This script should be executed each time you start your Matlab session.
3. Change into the directory ASPIRE/examples
4. Enjoy the example scripts
