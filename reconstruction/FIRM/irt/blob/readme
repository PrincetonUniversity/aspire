These m-files are useful for creating the blurred blob footprints
that are needed for SPECT reconstruction with depth-dependent detector
response (and nonuniform attenuation compensation) using ASPIRE with
the "3s" system model (see "i proj3" or the ASPIRE 3D user's guide).

Type "help blob_li_blur" (or look at blob_li_blur.m) for more details.

See blob_example.csh for an example recon script.  That script was used
for the June 2004 PMB paper by Yendiki and Fessler on 3D SPECT using blobs.
