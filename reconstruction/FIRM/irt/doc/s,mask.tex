\subsection{Masking}

One subtle point is that we usually display images
as a rectangular grid of $\ty{nx} \times \ty{ny}$ pixels,
but usually the iterative algorithms
work on column vectors.
Often only a subset of the pixels are updated,
as illustrated in
\fref{fig,reg,mask,6,5}.
A logical array called the \ty{mask}
specifies which pixels are to be updated.
The function call
\ty{x_col = x_array(mask(:))}
extracts the relevant pixel elements
``within the mask''
into a column vector.
Conversely, the call
\ty{x_array = embed(x_col, mask)}
puts the elements of the column vector
back into the appropriate places
in the array.

\newcommand{\fdir}{book/c-reg/fig}
\infig{fig,reg,mask,6,5}{0.4}

The following code illustrates these ideas.

\begin{verbatim}
mask = false(6,5); mask([9 10 14:17 21 22]) = true;
xc = [10:5:45]';
xa = embed(xc, mask)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
Here is the resulting output.

\begin{verbatim}
0     0     0     0     0
0     0    20     0     0
0    10    25    40     0
0    15    30    45     0
0     0    35     0     0
0     0     0     0     0
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
Conversely,
typing the following
produces a vector that is the same as the original \ty{xc} vector.
\begin{verbatim}
xa(mask)
\end{verbatim}
