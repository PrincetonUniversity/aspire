this directory has MR data from Doug Noll
for testing PWLS type of phase fitting.

In phfit.mat there is a complex image (variable: m1)
where the phase represents the magnetic field inhomogeneity and the
magnitude is just the image.

The echo-time difference associated with this scan is 2ms.

I don't remember what the file phfile.mat is.

For the benefit of those who cannot read .mat files,
I also include the big endian 64x64 float files
	phfit_im.raw
	phfit_re.raw
and the corresponding .fld header files (read with fld_read.m):
	phfit_im.fld
	phfit_re.fld

These phase data were used in my 2005 T-SP paper on Toeplitz based MR
image reconstruction.
